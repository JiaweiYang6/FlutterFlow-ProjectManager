# Project Manager App

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

FlutterFlow projects are built to run on the Flutter _stable_ release.

# Description
This is a FlutterFlow-built Project Manager App with the following components:

1. Supports user login and signup via email.
2. Users can create projects directly on the main page.
3. Each project listed on the main page is clickable, allowing users to navigate to the "Project Details" page.
4. Users can create Milestone plans and associate tasks with them.
5. Tasks are categorized into two sections: "not completed" and "completed."
6. Upon checking the checkbox, the task transitions from the "not completed" section to the "completed" section.
7. The Milestone plan provides a summary of task counts and the number of completed tasks.
8. Project creators have the ability to add or remove project members, who can access both the projects and their details.
9. All sections, including the due_date, are integrated seamlessly.
